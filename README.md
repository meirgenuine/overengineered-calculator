# Overengineered Calculator

## Overview
This project serves as an educational showcase, presenting an overengineered calculator to illustrate the application of common backend engineering technologies within a microservices architecture. Its primary purpose is educational, employing a straightforward business logic — a basic calculator — as a vehicle to demonstrate the intricate workings and integration of various advanced technologies. The project encompasses Go, gRPC, REST API, Docker, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, and more, thus offering a comprehensive insight into backend development practices. Through this project, the simplicity of a calculator's functionality is transformed into a complex system, aiming to provide a practical learning experience in modern software engineering techniques and tools.

## Services
- **API Gateway**: The entry point for the application, routing requests to the appropriate microservices.
- **Addition Service**: Handles addition operations.
- ... (and so on for each service)
