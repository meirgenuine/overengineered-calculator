# Overengineered Calculator

## Overview
This project is an overengineered calculator designed to demonstrate advanced backend engineering skills using microservices architecture. Technologies used include Go, gRPC, REST API, Docker, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ, and more.

## Services
- **API Gateway**: The entry point for the application, routing requests to the appropriate microservices.
- **Addition Service**: Handles addition operations.
- ... (and so on for each service)

## Project Structure
- `/api-gateway`: Contains the API Gateway service.
- `/addition-service`: Service for addition operations.
